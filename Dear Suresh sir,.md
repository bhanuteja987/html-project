Dear Suresh sir,

I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from my position as React Native developer at JobxRobot, effective 28/04/2023. I have enjoyed my time working with this organization and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given.

After careful consideration, I have decided to pursue other career opportunities. This decision was not an easy one to make, but I believe it is the right choice for me at this time.

I am committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. I will work diligently to complete any outstanding projects and will do my best to ensure that my departure does not cause any disruption to the company's operations. I am available to assist with the transition process in any way that I can.

I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the support and guidance that I have received during my time here. I have learned a great deal from my colleagues and have valued the experience.

Thank you again for the opportunities that you have provided to me, and I wish the company continued success in the future.

Sincerely,

D THIMMACHOWDARY
